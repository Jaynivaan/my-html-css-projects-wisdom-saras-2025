            Understanding HTML-Entities
            &infin;
        </h1>

        <p>
            In Html some symbols have special meanings.<br>
            for example:- , the signs <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> are used for tags.<br>
            To display them as text, we use <strong>Html-Entities</strong><br>
            ie, codes that begin with <code>&amp;</code> and end with a semicolon (<code>;</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Examples:
            <ul>
                <li>&lt; =<strong>less than</strong></li>
                <li>&gt; =<strong>greater than</strong></li>
                <li>&amp; =<strong>ampersand</strong></li>
                <li>&hearts; = <strong>heart</strong></li>
                <li>&infin; = <strong>infinity</strong></li>
                <li>&copy; = <strong> the copyright mark <i>by writing copy between ambersand and semicolon</i></strong></li>
                
            </ul>

            <h2>
                ORDER OF UNDERSTANDING HTML Entities
            </h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Notice that you *cannot* see directly- like &lt; hidden &gt; tags of existence .</li>
                <li>seek the code that creates the world- beyond thoughts, vibration and names or forms. </li>
                <li>Decode each form in front of you using the awareness- see  beyond &amp; illusions; and &amp;ego;.</li>
                <li>Realize that behind every &amp; entity;lies the same &infin; infinite source .</li>

            </ol>
