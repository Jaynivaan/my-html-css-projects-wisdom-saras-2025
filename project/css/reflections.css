/*READ ME LIKE A STORY*/

/*WHAT are we doing?
-HTML is the body.
-bootstrap is box of readymade clothes  already stiched with buttons,grids and spacings.
-reflections.css is the rooom where we color and decorate the clothes..


HOW DO WE STYLE?
-USE Bootstrap classes for quick layout.
-work inside reflections.css to paint a life to style this (colors,shadows,hover effects)

SIMPLE RULES::
-BOOTSTRAP  link first.
-reflections.css link next.
-Test one section at a time(header -> hero -> Practice -> Gallery -> Pledge).

MORE valuable Words for a fool like me::

-*"make it in a line"= display: flex ( or Bootstrap row/col).
-*"make it in a box"= padding+border+shadow.
-*"All Pictures same size" = height is same + object-fit: cover.
