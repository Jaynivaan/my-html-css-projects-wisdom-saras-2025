Portfolio website specific readme
==================================
hi sir, this is a website i created as part of my assignment.. 
in this website there are three sections
#genesis
#churning and 
#stillness

eventhough this is a portfolio website i love to tie an utility to the user who visit the site so i included this three sections to depict the wisdom on the real nature of absolute reality of nondual oneness,.. 


#genesis
========

the genesis section i depicted a mirror to remind the user that world is a mirror which expands upon observation..


#churning
=========

the churning section i added a activity for the user to click for looking beyond . by comiting this section wanted the user to get curious to see what s beyond.. not in this section but in dream itself.. upon invoking lookbeyond, user get of see an effect of an interface communicating to user with mistakes..this section depicts every thing will communicate if you listen to it.. the dream fabricc is very much smarter and responsive than the limited humanity.. also by adding mistakes iwanted to tell the user that nothing is perfect and user should stop finding imperctions on what he see and learn discernment and acceptance..


#stillness
==========

the stillness  section i added a window and particles beyond moving randomly.. upon interaction it will slow down .. also added a silencebutton.. this section tells user how time looses its relevance when approaching the absolute.. the death will dissolve at its peak which i depicted with silence button.. user onclick upon this button the whole screen goes white for 2s ..

Html, css, js work behind the scenes..
